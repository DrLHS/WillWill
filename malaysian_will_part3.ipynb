    "INSTRUCTIONS FOR SIGNING YOUR WILL\n",
    "\n",
    "CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR VALIDITY (Wills Act 1959, Section 5):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. TESTATOR SIGNATURE\n",
    "   - You (the testator) must sign at the END of the will\n",
    "   - Use blue or black ink (for original identification)\n",
    "   - Sign in the presence of BOTH witnesses AT THE SAME TIME\n",
    "   - Both witnesses must be physically present when you sign\n",
    "\n",
    "2. WITNESS SIGNATURES\n",
    "   - Both witnesses must sign AFTER you sign\n",
    "   - Both must sign while you are present\n",
    "   - Both must sign while each other is present\n",
    "   - All three people must be in the same room at the same time\n",
    "\n",
    "3. WITNESS QUALIFICATIONS\n",
    "   - Must be 18+ years old (preferably 21+)\n",
    "   - Must be of sound mind\n",
    "   - CANNOT be beneficiaries named in the will\n",
    "   - CANNOT be spouses of beneficiaries\n",
    "   - CAN be the executor if executor is not also a beneficiary\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. EXECUTION PROCESS\n",
    "   Step 1: Gather yourself and BOTH witnesses in the same room\n",
    "   Step 2: Ensure all three people can see the will\n",
    "   Step 3: You sign at the designated space at the end\n",
    "   Step 4: First witness signs in their designated space\n",
    "   Step 5: Second witness signs in their designated space\n",
    "   Step 6: All signatures must be in front of each other\n",
    "\n",
    "5. AFTER SIGNING\n",
    "   - Store the ORIGINAL will safely (consider professional custody)\n",
    "   - Never staple, clip, or mark the original\n",
    "   - Inform your executor where the original is kept\n",
    "   - Consider giving a copy (not original) to your executor\n",
    "   - Review and update your will every 3-5 years or after major life events\n",
    "\n",
    "6. IMPORTANT REMINDERS\n",
    "   - Marriage/remarriage automatically REVOKES your will\n",
    "   - Divorce does NOT revoke your will - make a new one\n",
    "   - EPF/KWSP requires separate nomination (not covered by will)\n",
    "   - Insurance policies require separate nominations\n",
    "   - Joint bank accounts pass by survivorship, not through will\n",
    "   - This will should be for NON-MUSLIMS only (Muslims need Wasiat)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. PROFESSIONAL REVIEW\n",
    "   - Consider having this will reviewed by a lawyer\n",
    "   - Cost for lawyer review: typically RM500-1500\n",
    "   - This ensures all clauses are legally sound\n",
    "   - Especially important for complex estates (> RM1 million)\n",
    "\n",
    "8. WILL CUSTODY OPTIONS\n",
    "   - Home safe (inform executor of location)\n",
    "   - Bank safe deposit box\n",
    "   - Professional custody services (Rockwills, AmanahRaya)\n",
    "   - Law firm custody\n",
    "   - DO NOT keep with executor if executor is also beneficiary\n",
    "\n",
    "PROBATE PROCESS (After Death):\n",
    "Your executor will need to:\n",
    "1. Locate the original will\n",
    "2. Engage a lawyer to apply for Grant of Probate\n",
    "3. High Court process typically takes 6-12 months\n",
    "4. Cost: RM5,000-15,000 for straightforward estates\n",
    "5. Once probate granted, executor distributes assets per your wishes\n",

    "For questions or concerns, consult a qualified lawyer specializing\n",
    "in estate planning and probate in Malaysia.\n",
